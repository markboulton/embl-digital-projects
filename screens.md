# Information screens at EMBL sites

- Project status: On hold
- Dependencies: Update the Drupal 8 system, run from Hamburg, which adds events to the screens, to manage all sites. Update screen hardware (run on Raspberry Pi in Heidelberg)

### Summary

Digital screens at each of EMBL's six sites display relevant daily information, such as lists of daily lectures and seminars, the restaurant menu or shuttle timetables.

The current system for updating the screens is not user-friendly, and each site has its own solution. This project is to simplify and centralise publishing to the screens to use a Drupal installation with location options.
