# Events and courses

- Status: Not started
- Dependencies: [Content Hub](content-hub.md), [Visual Framework](visual-framework.md), [EDR](edr.md), Back end for events

### Summary

Migrating events and courses data to new systems which integrate with the Content Hub.

The Courses and Conferences (CCO) department have a user registration system for events. These keep a database of users and the conferences that they attended. Members of the department also post the same events to the EMBL website using Fiona. 

Plan: Integrate the events systems with the Content Hub, so that CCO do not have to post everything twice. 

### Prototypes
