# Group pages

Deliver 10 group pages for the MVP version of the Wordpress group page installation, on the EBI infrastructure, 
using David's theme and the Visual Framework. 

### Summary

This project will deliver Wordpress installations with the EMBL theme for 10 group pages. The minimum viable product (MVP) for a group page is a Wordpress site with the tabs About, Members, Publications and Contact. We will start with the groups that use this existing structure with no bespoke tabs. 

### Prototypes

- Design from Mark
- Group pages content audit (https://bit.ly/2H1xEnI)
- Visual Framework (http://dev-vf-theme-prototype.pantheonsite.io/)
